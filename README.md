### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Noppanut, or you can call me "Top"! I am an engineer at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) who enjoys working with both software and network engineering.

I am the author of [depthviz](https://github.com/noppanut15/depthviz), a Python CLI tool for generating depth tracking overlays for the freediving footage from exported dive computer logs. 

Given the project I am working on, YES!, I am a passionate freediver and scuba diver. I am a certified conservation diver, helping non-profit organizations conduct marine research and conservation activities.

If you are interested in helping out with the depthviz, feel free to reach out or take a look at the issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/noppanut15/depthviz/labels/help%20wanted).
Non-divers are also welcome! Who knows, one day you could become a competitive freediver and use this tool yourself.
