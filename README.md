### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Noppanut, or you can call me "Top"! I'm an engineer at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/) who enjoys both software and network engineering.

I've just started a new project, [depthviz](https://github.com/noppanut15/depthviz), a Python CLI tool that generates depth tracking overlays for freediving footage from exported dive computer logs.

Given my project, you might guess it... YES! I'm a passionate freediver and scuba diver. I'm also a certified conservation diver, helping non-profit organizations conduct marine research and conservation activities.

If you're interested in helping out with depthviz, feel free to reach out or take a look at the issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/noppanut15/depthviz/labels/help%20wanted).
Non-divers are also welcome! Who knows, you could become a competitive freediver one day and use this tool yourself.
